   ### Using more Canvases
   Every time a single UI element inside a Canvas changes (e.g. change 1 Text or Image), the whole Canvas has to generate the meshes and draw them all
over again (very costly).

   ### Separating objects between static and dynamic Canvases
   * <b>Static Canvas</b>: contains UI elements that are <b>never</b> going to <b>change</b>; good examples of these are background images, labels, and so on.
   * <b>Incidental Dynamic Canvas</b>: contains UI elements that only <b>change in response</b> to something, such as a UI button press or hover action.
   * <b>Continuous Dynamic Canvas</b>: contains UI elements that <b>change regularly</b>, such as animated elements.

   ### Disabling Raycast Target for non-interactive elements
   For all <b><i>Image</i></b> components that are not part of a <b><i>Button</i></b>, disable the <b><i>Raycast Target</i></b> (basically disable it in all images except for buttons).
Each time there is a UI input (click, tap, scroll, etc.) Unity's <i>GraphicsRaycaster</i> iterates over all the <i>Raycast Targets</i> in the scene, so the less we have the
more processing we save.
